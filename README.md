Done by following course [A Crash Course in Unity's Entity Component System by Penny de Byl](https://www.udemy.com/course/learnecs/learn/lecture/19372452)

I've tried to minimize effect of not great practices but not spending a lot of time on it (wanted to focus on ECS):
1. No project structure (used separate folders)
1. No prefab variants
1. Code duplication
1. Two systems in one file
1. etc.
